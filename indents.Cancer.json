In cancer diagnosis, image recognition techniques are used to analyze medical images like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. <br>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of AI model for image recognition in cancer detection. <br> Genomic Analysis: Genomic analysis involves studying an individual's genetic material (genome) to identify genetic variations and mutations. <br>Genomic analysis can be used to find specific genetic mutations associated with cancer. It's essential for understanding the genetic basis of cancer and can inform personalized treatment strategies. Identifying specific mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. <br> Screening Tests: Perform specific screening tests that are appropriate for the type of cancer being considered.
